Rails vs Sinatra (by Roo)

Ruby is the bricks

Rails and Sinatra are the blueprints

Use the blueprint to build the building (faster, more efficiently, like Germans)

Sinatra is a shed, Rails is a 4-storey floor

Spree is another add-on 'blueprint' to make your blueprint an ecommerce mansion. Comes with models, controllers and views as required for an ecommerce website.

Sinatra you only have this one file (app), and a lot of views
